----------

Keep in mind that not all activity on GitHub is publicly visible; accounts with no visible activity may be in active use.

If the username you want has already been claimed, consider other names or unique variations. Using a number, hyphen, or an alternative spelling might help you identify a desirable username still available.

----------

GitHub prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be reserved or inactively held for future use. Accounts violating this name squatting policy may be removed or renamed without notice. Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.
