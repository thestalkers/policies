[](#how-github-uses-your-information)GitHub 如何使用您的信息
----------

We may use your information to provide, administer, analyze, manage, and operate our Service. For example, we use your information for the following purposes:

* Provide our products and deliver our services including troubleshooting, improving, and personalizing the features on the Service.

[](#how-we-share-the-information-we-collect)我们如何分享所收集的信息
----------

We share Personal Data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your Personal Data described above with the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:

### [](#public-information)Public information ###

You may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, [you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile](https://github.com/settings/emails). You can also [update your local Git configuration to use your private email address](/cn/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address). 有关提交消息中电子邮件地址的更多信息，请参阅[此处](/cn/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)。

Please note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our [Terms of Service](/cn/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.

### [](#third-party-applications)第三方应用程序 ###

We share your Personal Data with third parties when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on GitHub to share your Personal Data. 例如，如果您加入组织，则表明您愿意向组织所有者提供在组织访问日志中查看您的活动的权限。

You can enable or add third-party applications, known as "Developer Products" to your Account. 这些开发者产品并非使用 GitHub 的必要条件。 We will share your Personal Data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of Personal Data you choose to share with it. You can check our [API documentation](/cn/rest/reference/users) to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.

### [](#organizations-with-which-you-engage)Organizations with which you engage ###

You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your Personal Data. If you collaborate on or become a member of an organization, then its Account owners may receive your Personal Data. When you accept an invitation to an organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see [About Organization Membership](/cn/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/about-organization-membership)). Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your Personal Data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your Personal Data stored in the Account.

### [](#service-providers)服务提供商 ###

We share your Personal Data with service providers who process the information on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While GitHub processes all Personal Data in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. Such processing by service providers will be in compliance with applicable law including any relevant transfer mechanism.

### [](#affiliates)Affiliates We enable access to Personal Data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service. ###

### [](#for-security-purposes)出于安全目的 ###

We will disclose Personal Data if we believe it is necessary to:

* protect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
* operate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or
* protect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.

### [](#for-legal-disclosure)法律要求披露 ###

GitHub may disclose Personal Data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our [Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data](/cn/github/site-policy/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data).

### [](#change-in-control-or-sale)控制权变更或出售 ###

We may share your Personal Data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.

Please note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide Personal Data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share Personal Data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.

Finally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.

### [](#no-selling-of-personal-data)No Selling of Personal Data ###

We *do not* sell your Personal Data for monetary or other consideration as defined under California and Nevada state laws. You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it [here](#githubs-notice-to-california-residents).

[](#your-choices-regarding-our-processing-of-your-personal-data)您对我们处理您的个人数据的选择
----------

We provide choices about the Personal Data we collect about you. The choices you make will not apply to any Personal Data associated with an Organization under your Account.

Access, correction, and deletion. If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us). 您可以在个人资料中限制信息、保持更新个人信息或者联系 [GitHub 支持](https://support.github.com/contact)或 [GitHub 高级支持](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us)，以控制我们收集的信息。

We retain and use your information as described in this Privacy Statement, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile within 90 days of your request. 删除帐户后，某些数据，例如对其他用户仓库的贡献和对其他议题的评论，仍然保留。 However, we will delete or de-identify your Personal Data, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a ghost user. That said, the email address you have provided via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system. 如果您已选择将自己的电子邮件地址设为私密，则还应更新您的 Git 提交设置。 我们无法更改或删除 Git 提交历史记录中的数据 — 虽然 Git 软件设计用于维护记录，但我们让您来控制在该记录中放入哪些信息。

If GitHub processes Personal Data other than your profile information, such as information about you GitHub receives from [third parties](/cn/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, object to or restrict the processing of your Personal Data by contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) or [GitHub Premium Support](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us).

You can adjust the settings on your Account regarding the display of your Personal Data in private or public repositories or Personal Data processed in connection with Community Features (such as the GitHub Feed, the GitHub Globe, GitHub Explore, the GitHub Discussion Leaderboard) through [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).

Additionally, if you are unable to access certain Personal Data we have via the means described above, you can request access by contacting us as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.

### [](#data-portability)数据可移植性 ###

作为 GitHub 用户，您可以随时带走您的数据。 例如，您可以[将您的仓库克隆到桌面](/cn/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)，也可以使用我们的[数据移植工具](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-05-24-user-migration-api/)下载我们拥有的与您相关的信息。

### [](#communication-preferences)沟通偏好 ###

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. 例如，如果您向我们的支持团队提出请求，我们将通过电子邮件答复您。 You have control over how your email address is used and shared on and through our Service. You may manage your communication preferences in your [profile](https://github.com/settings/emails).

根据设计，Git 版本控制系统将许多操作与用户的电子邮件地址相关联，例如提交消息。 See more details regarding [setting your commit email address](https://github.com/settings/emails).

Depending on your [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), GitHub may occasionally send notification emails, for example, about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We may also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 在我们发送的每封营销电子邮件的底部，都有一个“退订”链接。

请注意，您不能选择不接收我们的重要通讯，例如来自我们支持团队的电子邮件或系统电子邮件，但是您可以在个人资料中配置通知设置以选择不接收其他通讯。

### [](#european-data-protection-rights)European Data Protection Rights ###

If the processing of Personal Data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:

You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, Personal Data; If any automated processing of Personal Data is based on your consent or a contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the Personal Data in a usable and portable format; If the processing of Personal Data is based on your consent, you can withdraw consent at any time for future processing; You can to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of Personal Data under certain circumstances; and For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding the use of your data after your death.

To make such requests, please use the contact information at the bottom of this statement. When we are processing data on behalf of another party (i.e., where GitHub is acting as a data processor) you should direct your request to that party. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.

We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing Personal Data about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.

[](#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking-technologies)Our use of cookies and tracking technologies
----------

### [](#cookies-and-tracking-technologies)Cookies and tracking technologies ###

GitHub uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, compile statistical reports, and provide information for future development of GitHub. We use our own cookies and do not use any third-party service providers in this context. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use our Service. We provide more information about [cookies on GitHub](/cn/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies#cookies-on-github) on our [GitHub Subprocessors and Cookies](/cn/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies) page that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

### [](#dnt)DNT ###

“[别跟踪](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track)”(DNT) 是有一种隐私首选项，如果您不希望在线服务（特别是广告网络）通过第三方跟踪服务收集和分享有关您在线活动的某类信息，您可以在浏览器中设置该选项。 GitHub 响应浏览器的 DNT 信号，并遵循[关于响应 DNT 信号的 W3C 标准](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/)。 如果您要设置浏览器以传达不希望被跟踪的信号，请查看浏览器的文档以了解如何启用该信号。 还有一些很适合阻止在线跟踪的应用程序，例如 [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)。

[](#retention-of-personal-data)Retention of Personal Data
----------

We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may retain your Personal Data for longer periods, where necessary, subject to applicable law, for security purposes.

[](#how-github-secures-your-information)GitHub 如何保护您的信息
----------

GitHub takes reasonable measures necessary to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your Personal Data. To help us protect personal data, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.

In addition, if your account has private repositories, you control the access to that Content. GitHub personnel does not access private repository content except for

* security purposes,
* automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service
