GitHub Logo Policy
==========

You can add GitHub logos to your website or third-party application in some scenarios. For more information and specific guidelines on logo usage, see the [GitHub Logos and Usage page](https://github.com/logos).

You can also use an octocat as your personal avatar or on your website to link to your GitHub account, but not for your company or a product you're building. GitHub has an extensive collection of octocats in the [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). For more information on using the octocats from the Octodex, see the [Octodex FAQ](https://octodex.github.com/faq/).
